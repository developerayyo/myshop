    "description": "3 Megapixel Wireless Dome Camera is the latest in HD security camera technology offering convenience in installation by sending video wirelessly over a WiFi network. The WD3MP is a wireless IP camera with a built-in 802.11 b/g/n client radio that is compatible with 2.4GHz WiFi routers which makes it easy to setup the camera, and cost-effective as well by doing away with requirement of having a paired wireless receiver for each camera. Wireless IP camera technology allows for wireless video transmission from multiple cameras over an existing WiFi network (e.g. your router) to our NVR recorders, WiFi NVR, to a computer, or mobile device. If you don't need video recording, you can simply use our remote viewing app on an iPhone, iPad, or Android device to view the camera from anywhere in the world over the internet. Viewing over the internet simply requires broadband internet where the camera is installed.\r\n\r\nThis wireless dome camera has a 3MP CMOS sensor that provides realtime 1080P video at 30fps or 3MP video at 20fps, making this camera a HD wireless security camera. Using bitrate control settings in the camera configuration menu allows the user to choose video resolution, frames per second, and video bitrate to optimize bandwidth used by the camera. In addition, it offers dual H.264 video streams, i.e. main stream for high resolution video for recording to a NVR and sub stream for remote viewing on a mobile device.\r\n\r\nThis dome camera is vandal resistant to IK10 standards, and IP67 weather proof making it suitable for use indoors or outdoors. The 3.6mm lens provides a wide angle 77 degree view, which is great for general surveillance. Thanks to the 1080P HD video resolution of this camera, you can zoom in to finer detail to see a face up to 30ft away. The camera also has up to 100ft of infrared night vision. There are also great image enhancements features like backlight compensation (BLC) and Digital Wide Dynamic Range (DWDR) which provide exposure compensation for scenarios such as sun glare.\r\n\r\nYou can power this camera easily with a 12V DC 1amp power adapter. To record video we suggest using one of our IP camera NVR, or our newest wireless WiFi NVR.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nWireless Vandal Resistant Dome Camera\r\nIP67 Weather Proof\r\n3 Megapixel progressive scan CMOS sensor\r\nH.264 video encoding \r\nDual Video Streaming - main stream / sub stream\r\nUser selectable recording resolution\r\n20fps at 3MP\r\n30fps at 1080P\r\nWide Dynamic Range ( DWDR)\r\nDay/Night IR cut filter\r\nAWB, AGC, BLC\r\n3.6mm fixed lens for 77 degree view\r\n100ft IR distance\r\nOutdoor or Indoor Use\r\nAccepts 12V DC power\r\nIncluded:\r\n\r\n1x Wireless Security Camera Dome\r\n1x 12V 500mA Power Supply\r\nSpecifications\r\n\r\nWD3MP Specifications\r\nMegapixels:\t3MP\r\nImage Sensor:\t1/3\" progressive scan CMOS\r\nVideo Resolution:\t20fps at 3MP (2304 x 1536), 30fps 1080P (1920x1080), 720P (1280x720), D1 (704\u00d7480), CIF (352x240)\r\nLens:\t3.6 mm\r\nAngle of View\t77\u00b0\r\nMinimum Illumination:\t0.1 Lux F1.6 (color), 0 Lux (B&W)\r\nIR Distance:\t100ft\r\nProtocol:\tPrivate/ONVIF\r\nWeather Proof:\tIP66\r\nVandal Resistant:\tYes IK10\r\nOperating Temperature:\t-22\u00b0F to +122\u00b0F, Less than 95% RH\r\nDimensions:\t4.34\" x 3.2\" (diameter x height)\r\nPower:\t12V DC (6W)\r\nWeight:\t0.9 lbs",
